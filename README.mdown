 Online content providers such as news
portals constantly seek to attract large shares of online attention
by keeping their users engaged. A common challenge
is to identify which aspects of the online interaction influence
user engagement the most. We focus on one component
of engagement with online content, “stickiness”, concerned
with users “spending time” on a content provider site.

 (a) users spend most of their time
towards the top of the page, whereas in (b) users spend significant
amount of time further down the page, likely reading
and contributing comments to the news articles.

cursor tracking can inform about whether users
are attentive to certain content when reading it, and what
their experience was.
